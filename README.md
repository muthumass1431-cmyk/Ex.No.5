# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

# AI Tools Required: 

Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5 Model)

Platform: Web-based AI chat interface

Device: Laptop or Desktop Computer

Internet Connection: Required for online AI access

# Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.


# OUTPUT
# Scenario 1: Creative Story

## Naive Prompt:

“Write a story about a robot.”

### Response Summary:
Short and simple story with limited emotion and description.

### OUTPUT:
Once there was a robot named Zeno who lived in a factory. Every day, it worked making cars. One night, lightning struck the factory, and Zeno gained free will. Curious about the world, it left the factory to explore. Zeno met humans and learned about kindness. Though made of metal, it found happiness helping others.

## Basic Prompt:

“Write a 150-word story about a robot that learns emotions for the first time. Include conflict, resolution, and a moral lesson.”

### Response Summary:
Detailed, emotional story with clear structure and moral message.

### OUTPUT:
In a bustling city, a robot named Arlo was programmed only to clean streets. One rainy evening, Arlo saw a young girl crying because her pet bird flew away. Something unusual stirred inside its circuits — a desire to comfort her. Despite being made of steel, Arlo chased the bird until it returned to her shoulder. The girl hugged Arlo, and for the first time, it felt joy. When Arlo’s creator saw this, he realized machines could learn compassion. The moral: emotions, not logic, make us truly alive.


| Criteria | Naive Prompt | Basic Prompt |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Quality  | Medium       | High         |
| Accuracy | Medium       | High         |
| Depth    | Low          | High         |


# Scenario 2: Factual Question

## Naive Prompt:

“Tell me about photosynthesis.”

### Response Summary:
Basic definition without explanation of process.

### OUTPUT:
Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make food. They take sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make glucose and oxygen. It happens in the leaves with the help of chlorophyll.

## Basic Prompt:

“Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants, including the role of sunlight, chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide, in 150 words.”

### Response Summary:
Comprehensive explanation including process, formula, and biological importance.

### OUTPUT:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants produce their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. It takes place in the chloroplasts of leaf cells, where the pigment chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. This light energy drives the conversion of water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), which serves as the plant’s energy source. Oxygen (O₂) is released as a byproduct. The process can be summarized by the equation:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.
Photosynthesis is vital for life on Earth, as it provides both food and oxygen for all living organisms.


| Criteria | Naive Prompt | Basic Prompt |

| Quality  | Medium       | High         |
| Accuracy | High         | High         |
| Depth    | Medium       | High         |


# Scenario 3: Summarization

## Naive Prompt:

“Summarize climate change.”

### Response Summary:
Very short and general summary.

### OUTPUT:
Climate change is the increase in Earth’s temperature caused by pollution and greenhouse gases. It leads to melting ice, rising sea levels, and extreme weather conditions.

## Basic Prompt:

“Summarize the main causes, effects, and solutions to climate change in 100 words for a high school student.”

### Response Summary:
Organized summary covering all three key aspects in simple terms.

### OUTPUT:
Climate change occurs when greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap heat in the atmosphere, increasing global temperatures. Main causes include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial emissions. Its effects are melting glaciers, rising sea levels, floods, droughts, and loss of biodiversity. Solutions involve switching to renewable energy, planting trees, reducing plastic waste, and adopting eco-friendly habits. Governments and individuals must work together to slow down global warming and protect the planet for future generations.

| Accuracy | Medium       | High         |
| Depth    | Low          | High         |


# Scenario 4: Giving Advice

## Naive Prompt:

“Give me study tips.”

### Response Summary:
Simple, generic tips without structure.

### OUTPUT:
Study every day. Take notes and avoid distractions. Revise before exams and sleep well.

## Basic Prompt:

“Provide five practical study tips for college students preparing for exams. Include time management and memory improvement techniques.”

### Response Summary:
Structured list with actionable and practical tips.

### OUTPUT:
1. Plan Your Schedule: Divide topics into daily study goals and follow a timetable.

2. Use Active Recall: Test yourself with flashcards or quizzes instead of just reading.

3. Apply Pomodoro Technique: Study in 25-minute sessions with short breaks.

4. Boost Memory: Use mnemonics and mind maps to remember key concepts.

5. Stay Balanced: Get enough sleep, stay hydrated, and avoid multitasking.

These tips improve focus, reduce stress, and help retain information better before exams.
